# PowerBI

All of the showcasable POWER BI Projects I have ever done.
1. survey-data.xlsx is the dataset of DataSurveyReport.pbix Power BI Report. It's a dataset collected from a survey done on Data professionals. The report contains interactive dashboard on the data collected.
2. Datasets(.csv & .xlsx files) whose names start with AwesomeChocolates are used to create the AwesomeChocolatesSalesDataReport.pbix Power BI report where I analysed the sales data and also did some forecasting.
